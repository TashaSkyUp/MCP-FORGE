# MCPForge Web Interface Usage

MCPForge ships with a small web interface for managing tools that have been
collected from Python snippets. The interface is served from the root URL of
the running server.

## Open the UI

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
   By default it listens on <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>.
2. Point a web browser at the host and port where the server is running
   (for example <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>).

## Add a tool module

1. In the *Snippet Name* field enter a short label. This label is used to name
   the generated module.
2. Paste the Python code that contains one or more functions into the *Code
   Snippet* area.
3. Click **Ingest**. The server calls the configured LLM to choose which
   functions to expose. Newly created modules appear in the *Registered
   Modules* list below the form.

## Remove a tool module

Each entry in the *Registered Modules* list has a **Remove** button. Clicking
this button deletes the corresponding module and unregisters its tools. The
list updates automatically after removal.

## Test a tool

Tools with example parameters generated by the LLM include a **Test** button.
Clicking **Test** runs the tool with its stored example parameters and displays
the output in the message area above the list.
